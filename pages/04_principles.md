- test code and app code should be linked together
- readability and maintainability is the #1 contributing factor to project being slow
- testing should improve speed of delivery
- testing should mitigate risk
- human time is more valuable than machine time

<!--
- something that testers don’t like to hear (I don’t like to hear that as well), is that in most situations, testing is a liability
- maintenance cost, worker cost, tooling,... all that cost your company money
- many companies make the mistake of looking at testing as liability and cut budgets, lay off people
- the thing is - and we all understand it as testers, that there is a value in testing and that without it, things will get worse
- but let’s be honest, we can also make things worse - if testing takes too much time. requires too many people, costs too much (and I mean this relative to the size of the company, size of the project etc.)
