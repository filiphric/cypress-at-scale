# Scaling - when and why?

- growth of the test number
- growth of the test execution time
- growth of the project under test
- growth of the services
- growth of the team

<!--
- each of these poses a different problem
- some of these require to decide early in the project, some are OK to decide later
- and of course, as every project is different, there are different requirements
- generally there’s a very simple threshold that gives you a clear signal that your project is on the scale up trajectory - it is no longer possible to maintain it with one or two people
- so sometimes this is when a project has 100 tests, sometimes it’s when it has 500 tests and sometimes it’s when you just have 30 tests, but they are on three different project
