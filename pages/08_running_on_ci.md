# Running in CI

- tagging tests
- configuration
- running in parallel

<!--
- Cypress really pushed hard on the idea of running your end to end test on your pull requests, or even on every commit
- it came at the time when CI/CD pipelines were getting integrated left and right in companies
- but as your project grows, you may get to a point where your build finishes in 1 minute, but your e2e tests run for 45 - everyone hates that, and for once again, testing is becoming a liability
